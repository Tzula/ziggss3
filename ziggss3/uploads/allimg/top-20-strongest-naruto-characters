Kakashi's extensive and varied skill-set allow him to effectively provide invaluable support against opponents of any level in any situation. Since early childhood, Kakashi was hailed as a natural genius, evident by his meteoric rise through the ninja ranks; entering the Academy on his first try and graduating in a year at top of his class at age 5 (which impressed his sensei Minato), becoming a chūnin at age 6, as well as jōnin and Anbu captain while still a child. He could even fight back an entire squad of elite Kiri-nin as a child. He is frequently given responsibility for important tasks, such as keep the seal containing the Nine-Tails in Naruto intact. For years, Kakashi has been considered by many prominent people to be one of the most suitable candidates for Hokage, eventually becoming the Sixth Hokage even after recently losing his Sharingan, showing that his abilities haven't weakened. His prowess and reputation as Hokage has even shown much political weight, able to make the rest of the shinobi world respect his views. <br><br>Most enemies grow afraid or excited at the idea of fighting Kakashi and likewise his prowess has earned him great praise from various prominent ninja, such as the S-rank members of Akatsuki. Itachi Uchiha noted that fighting Kakashi alone was dangerous with a high chance of injuries, while Pain, the most powerful member of Akatsuki, viewed Kakashi as a major threat that needed to be eradicated to allow his plans to progress. He could even handle himself against the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, as well as the Ten-Tails itself. After obtaining both Sharingan and the Six Paths Power from Obito, Kakashi's abilities allowed him to threaten and even harm Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, the most powerful chakra user in history.</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt28828273">1 Like </b> <b id='shb28828273'></b><p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="http://www.nairaland.com/attachments/1937879_kakask_png3a667d9d5fb6a133cb5fc9ae1133a302"> <tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="28828747"></a><a name="msg28828747"></a><a name="2041844.6"></a><a href="/2041844/top-20-strongest-naruto-characters#28828747">Re: Top 20 Strongest Naruto Characters.

Even as a child before becoming a shinobi, he was able to kill a chūnin while protecting Yahiko. <br>His partner, Konan, had stated that he had never lost a single battle, and that he was &quot;unbeatable&quot;. Fukasaku stated that without understanding Pain's power, no one could defeat him, and even Obito noted that Nagato was invincible while praising Jiraiya. Nagato was able to kill Jiraiya with relative ease after revealing all six of his bodies. It was with these six bodies that Nagato led a civil war in Amegakure that not only easily killed Hanzō and overthrew his regime, but also eradicated his lineage and anyone remotely associated with him and his ideals.<br><br> He was also able to effortlessly defeat Orochimaru, making Orochimaru join Akatsuki after finding him.[35] Even Kakashi Hatake, who is noted to be one of Konoha's top shinobi, opted not to face Nagato alone,[36] and ultimately was defeated by the latter alongside Chōza and Chōji Akimichi. Zetsu expressed shock when Nagato was defeated by Naruto Uzumaki, stating that he never thought Nagato would ever lose, even in a weakened state.<br><br>After being reincarnated by Kabuto Yakushi and regaining most of his vitality, Nagato was able to easily overwhelm both Naruto Uzumaki in his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and Killer B whom used the power of Gyūki as well, and Nagato would have killed them both had it not been for Itachi Uchiha's intervention. It took the combined efforts of those three men to successfully defeat him. In this regard, he was considered to be Kabuto Yakushi's second strongest reincarnated shinobi, since the latter noted that he'd have to bring out his trump card after Nagato was sealed.<br><br>Nagato's legs were greatly damaged in his battle against Hanzō. As a result, even though he was able to stand on his own, he lacked full mobility. To make up for this, while alive, Nagato used the Six Paths of Pain to fight for him while he remained in a mechanical walker. When he was reincarnated by Kabuto, he used various summons to move around and to keep himself out of range of his opponents' attacks. Though even after being rejuvenated by Gyūki's chakra, which he had absorbed from Killer B, Nagato's mobility was still limited.</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt28829057">1 Like </b> <b id='shb28829057'></b><p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="http://www.nairaland.com/attachments/1937941_naga_png102059f553bbf997a63bdad61bc40cae"> <tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="28829102"></a><a name="msg28829102"></a><a name="2041844.10"></a><a href="/2041844/top-20-strongest-naruto-characters#28829102">Re: Top 20 Strongest Naruto Characters.

When, years later, the invasion of Konoha loomed, Minato was believed to be the only one who could have stopped the threat Orochimaru posed to Konoha, and for that reason his death was deeply regretted.

He was dead-last in the Academy, struggled with basic ninjutsu and had failed to graduate three times. In fact, while he could not produce a proper Clone Technique, he was able to create the Sexy Technique; an inventive but entirely useless diversionary technique. However, through sheer willpower and perseverance, Naruto managed to push past this stumbling block to learn very difficult and complex techniques as a late bloomer, earning his graduation by mastering the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique. Naruto's rapid growth during Part I enabled him to fight on par with noteworthy prodigious and skilled shinobi such as Sasuke Uchiha and Gaara, as well as master several high-level techniques, usually within the allotted time frame.

Naruto's fighting style, much like his father's, rarely used hand seals other than for his signature Shadow Clone Technique.<br><br>After his training with Jiraiya for two-and-a-half years, Naruto has developed his abilities to match the S-rank members of Akatsuki. Upon defeating their strongest member and leader Pain, Naruto was praised by Konoha villagers as a hero worthy of earning the Hokage title. By the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto's presence on the battlefield became much like his father's; with his unique skill set, he could dramatically change the outcome of the battle even against several Kage-level shinobi. After receiving the Six Paths Chakra, he was shown capable of overwhelming the Ten-Tails jinchūriki, Madara Uchiha, and even Kaguya Ōtsutsuki on separate occasions. By war's end, Naruto has been acknowledged by others to have surpassed all of the previous Hokage.<br><br> Despite being low on chakra from the war, as well as holding back during their final battle, Naruto managed to defeat his old rival Sasuke, who was noted to have gained comparable prowess to Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki. Two years after the war, he has become so famous that Konoha gets visitors from different parts of the world just to meet him.
